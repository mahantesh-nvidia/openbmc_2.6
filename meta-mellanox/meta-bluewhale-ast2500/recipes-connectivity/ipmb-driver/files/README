IPMB use cases on the BlueField Reference Platform
--------------------------------------------------

The BMC has 2 IPMB modes. It can be used as a responder
but also as a requester.
'BF' is an alias for BlueField SoC.


MODE 1:
------

When used as a requester, the BMC sends IPMB request
messages to the BF via SMBus 12. The BF then, processes
the request and sends a message back to the BMC.
So the BMC needs to load the ipmb_host.ko module
when the BF is up. If the BF is not up, the ipmb_host.ko
will fail to load because it has to execute a handshake
with the other end before loading.


MODE 2:
------

When used as a responder, the BMC receives IPMB
request messages from the BF on SMBus 12. It then,
processes the message and sends a response back to the BF.
So the BMC needs to load the ipmb_dev_int.ko.

At the moment, the cases above cannot coexist i.e. they
cannot work simultaneously at boot time. So only mode 1
(BMC is the requester), is enabled automatically at
boot time.
obmc-mellanox-ipmbd.service calls obmc-mellanox-ipmbd.sh.
That script checks whether the BF is up, and if it is,
loads ipmb_host.ko.

If the user wants to switch to mode 2 (BMC is the
responder), they need to run the load_bf2bmc_ipmb.sh
script from the BMC. But make sure that the
appropriate driver is also loaded on the BF side.

Example on the BlueField Reference Platform:
--------------------------------------------

1) At boot time, the BMC is by default set as the IPMB
   requester. So the user can issue ipmitool commands
   from the BMC to the BF.

2) If the user wants to switch to the mode where the BMC
   acts as the responder:
   a) run the following script from the BMC first:
      load_bf2bmc_ipmb.sh
   b) Then, (this has to be done after step a),
      run the following script from the BF:
      load_bf2bmc_ipmb.sh
   c) The user may now issue ipmitool commands from the BF.

3) If the user wishes to revert back from 2) to the default 1)
   without having to reboot:
   a) run the following script from the BF first:
      load_bmc2bf_ipmb.sh
   b) Then, (this has to be done after step a),
      run the following script from the BMC:
      load_bmc2bf_ipmb.sh
   c) The user may issue ipmitool commands from the BMC.
